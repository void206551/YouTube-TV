A way to use YouTube TV on your computer.

## Install 
You can either build from the source or install from the [latest releases](https://github.com/void206551/YouTube-TV/releases/).

If you choose to build from source, follow these steps:
 1. Clone repository
 2. Open directory in CMD/PowerShell/Terminal
 3. Run `npm install`
 4. Run `npm run make`
Once the make command is completed, you can navigate to `\out\make\[squirrel.windows][deb][rpm]\x64` from the source directory and find the file executable.
